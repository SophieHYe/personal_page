This is Ye. Welcome to my page.
I am a Lecturer (aka. Assistant Professor) in the Department of Computer Science at University College London.
Previously, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Carnegie Mellon University (2023 to 2025) with [Prof. Claire Le Goues](https://clairelegoues.com/).
I obtained my PhD from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in February 2023, where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Martin Monperrus](https://www.monperrus.net/martin/) and [Prof. Benoit Baudry](https://softwarediversity.eu/).

My research focuses on developing the next generation of code agents to automate software engineering tasks. I work on codebase context retrieval and long-term memory for code agents.
Specifically, my research interests are:
- Improving codebase context retrieval precision through graph–based reasoning.
- Building intelligent code agents for issue resolution, environment setup, terminal tasks, and reproduction test generation.
- Model–agent and multi-agent orchestration.


Beyond academia, I am the co-founder of [EuniAI](https://euni.ai/), 
a UCL spinout dedicated to transforming research into real-world solutions and providing a showcase platform for our research outcomes.

We are organizing the [LMPL@SPLASH 2025 workshop](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-splash-2025/lmpl-2025) and the [APR@ICSE 2025 workshop](https://program-repair.org/workshop-2025/), we look forward to your submissions!
